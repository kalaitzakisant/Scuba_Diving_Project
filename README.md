# Applying Deep Learning Techniques to Detect and Classify Marine Animals

A Deep learning object detection model developed to assist with the identification of marine life during scuba diving or snorkeling trips.

In order to make this project accessible and easy to use by everyone, we have combined our code into 3 Jupyter Notebook from which anyone can choose depending on the task they want to complete.
The 3 available notebooks can assist divers, snorkelers or software developers with:
1. Recognising Marine Animals using Photographs or Videos = Use the "_Detection Notebook_"
2. Train a new Deep Learning model with your own marine animal dataset = Use the "_YOLOv7 Training - Scuba Diving Project_" notebook
3. Annotate your Marine Animals Photographs with classes to develop your own Dataset with LabelImg software = Use the "_LabelImg_" notebook.


1. Detection Notebook

The detection notebook is used for detecting Marine Animals from previously taken photographs or videos. Currently it can recognise clownfish, trumpetfish, turtles, dolphins and corals.
